See the header of modp_b64w.c for the license terms.

The modp_b64w.c file was modified to remove the inclusion of modp's config.h.
The file was renamed modp_b64w.cc to force it to be compiled as C++ so that
the inclusion of basictypes.h could be possible.

The file modp_b64w_data.h was generated by modp_b64w_gen.c (under Linux), which
is not included in this directory. The resulting header was modified to remove
the "#include <stdint.h>" since that header file does not exist under VC8. The
required typedefs for uint8_t and uint32_t were defined in its place.

Sources are compiled with -DNWORDS_BIGENDIAN for little endian architecture, use
-DNWORDS_BIGENDIAN for big endian architectures.

modp_b64w.cc is configured for using no padding and the padding character is set
to '\0'.
