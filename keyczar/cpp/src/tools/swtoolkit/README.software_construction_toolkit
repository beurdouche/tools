        Software Construction Toolkit - a set of extensions for SCons

This is the README.software_construction_toolkit file for the Software
Construction Toolkit.

You are likely reading this file in one of the following two situations:

    1)  You have downloaded Software Construction Toolkit from code.google.com
        and are examining the contents.

    2)  This file was included in some other software package so that the
        package could be built using Software Construction Toolkit.

        In this case, follow the instructions provided with the rest of the
        software package for how to use Software Construction Toolkit to build
        and/or install the software.

EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
======================

Software Construction Toolkit requires:

    * Python 2.4 or later.
          o For example, from http://www.python.org
          o If on Windows, also need the pywin32 extensions
            (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
          o Software Construction Toolkit is not yet compatible with Python 3.

    * SCons 1.2 or later.
          o For example, from http://www.scons.org/download.php
          o A scons or scons-local install is required for building projects.
          o A scons-src install is required for developing Software
            Construction Toolkit.

There should be no other direct dependencies or requirements to run the
Software Construction Toolkit.


INSTALLATION
============

Installation of this package is as simple as copying its directory tree to any
directory.

If you are using the hammer.bat or hammer.sh entry point, you also need to set
up a SCONS_DIR environment variable to point to the directory containing SCons.

    * For a normal SCons install, this is the engine subdir.
    * For a scons-local install, this is the . subdir.
    * For a scons-src install, this is the src/engine subdir.
    * For a Windows install of SCons which used a .exe or .msi installer, SCons
      may be installed in a subdirectory of the Python directory. For example,
      C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages\scons-1.2.0.

If you are modifying Software Construction Toolkit and need to run the unit
tests, set up a SCONS_DEV_DIR environment variable to point to the directory
containing the scons-src install.

Once you have installed this package, you should write a main.scons file at the
top level of your source tree to build your software.

Then modify the build/install instructions for your package to instruct
your users to execute Software Construction Toolkit by running hammer.bat or
hammer.sh.
