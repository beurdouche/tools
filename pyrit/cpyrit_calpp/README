CPyrit-CAL++
+++++++++++++

A sub-package that adds CAL++ capability to Pyrit. Please see the main README
for more information about Pyrit.

http://code.google.com/p/pyrit/



Requirements
++++++++++++

CPyrit-CAL++ compiles and runs on Linux and MacOS. Windows is not (and
probably never will be) supported.
A couple of libraries and headers are required to build CPyrit-CAL++:

  * Python >=2.5 and it's headers
    http://www.python.org
  * The OpenSSL library and headers
    http://www.openssl.org
  * ATI drivers 
  * ATI Stream SDK
    http://developer.amd.com/gpu/ATIStreamSDK/Pages/default.aspx
  * CAL++ library >=0.90
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/calpp/

Linux users running a binary distribution may need to install the development
packages for Python (e.g. python-devel), OpenSSL (e.g. openssl-devel or
libssl-dev). You also need a C++ compiler like gcc.
Users of MacOS probably only need to have XCode installed.

By default, setup.py looks into directory pointed by environment variable
ATISTREAMSDKROOT to find the ATI CAL headers. Modify setup.py if you have
installed these elsewhere.



Installing
++++++++++

Unpack the source-code into a new directory like this:

    tar xvzf cpyrit-calpp-0.4.0.tar.gz


Switch to the module's directory. We use Python's distutils to compile and
install the code:

    cd cpyrit-calpp-0.4.0
    python setup.py build


If everything went well and no errors are thrown at you, use distutils again to
install CPyrit-CAL++:

    sudo python setup.py install


You should see your CAL++ capable devices listed when executing
'pyrit list_cores'.



Reporting bugs / Getting help
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please take a look at the Troubleshooting-page in Pyrit's Wiki if you have
problems compiling or running Pyrit:
