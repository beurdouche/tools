      # gcc 4.2.1 flags the following error
      # In file included from attacks.c:32:
      # gnushogi.h:144: error: conflicting types for ‘setlinebuf’
      # /usr/include/stdio.h:351: error: previous declaration of ‘setlinebuf’ was here
      #
      # My patch fixes this by changing the declared return type of setlinebuf in
      # gnushogi.h to int to match up with stdio.h's declaration
      # It was returning void anyway, so unless something errantly relies on it not
      # leaving something in the return register, this shouldn't break anything
