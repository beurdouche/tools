        This build of GRASS has been compiled without the WxPython GUI. This is
        done by default on Lion because there is no stable build of WxPython
        available to compile against.

        The command line tools remain fully functional.
        EOS
    else
      <<-EOS.undent
        GRASS is currently in a transition period with respect to GUI support.
        The old Tcl/Tk GUI cannot be built using the version of Tcl/Tk provided
        by OS X.  This has the unfortunate consquence of disabling the NVIZ
        visualization system.  A keg-only Tcl/Tk brew or some deep hackery of
        the GRASS source may be possible ways to get around this around this.

        Tcl/Tk will eventually be depreciated in GRASS 7 and this version has
        been built to support the newer wxPython based GUI.  However, there is
        a problem as wxWidgets does not compile as a 64 bit library on OS X
        which affects Snow Leopard users.  In order to remedy this, the GRASS
        startup script:

          #{prefix}/grass-6.4.0/etc/Init.sh

        has been modified to use the OS X system Python and to start it in 32 bit mode.

Patch 1:
Force 32-bit system Python to be used for the WxPython GUI.

Patch 2:
Remove two lines of the Makefile that try to install stuff to
/Library/Documentation---which is outside of the prefix and usually fails due
to permissions issues.
