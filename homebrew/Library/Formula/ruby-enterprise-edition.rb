    By default we don't compile REE as a shared library. From their documentation:
        Please note that enabling --enable-shared will make the Ruby interpreter
        about 20% slower.

    For desktop environments (particularly ones requiring RubyCocoa) this is
    acceptable and even desirable.

    If you need REE to be compiled as a shared library, you can re-compile like so:
        brew install ruby-enterprise-edition --force --enable-shared
    EOS
  end
end
