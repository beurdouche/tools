      You may want to symlink this Framework to a standard OS X location,
      such as:
        mkdir -p ~/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
        ln -s "#{prefix}/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2" ~/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2

      A "distutils.cfg" has been written, specifing the install-scripts folder as:
        #{scripts_folder}

      If you install Python packages via "python3 setup.py install", easy_install3,
      pip-3.2, any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder above, so
      you may want to add it to your PATH.

      Distribute has been installed, so easy_install is available.
      To update distribute itself outside of Homebrew:
        #{scripts_folder}/easy_install3 pip
        #{scripts_folder}/pip-3.2 install --upgrade distribute
