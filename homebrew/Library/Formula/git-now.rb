# This patch makes sure GNUtools are used on OSX.
# gnu-getopt is keg-only hence the backtick expansion.
# These aliases only exist for the duration of git-now,
# inside the git-now shells. Normal operation of bash is
# unaffected - getopt will still find the version supplied
# by OSX in other shells, for example.
