    Before you can use these tools you must export some variables to your $SHELL
    and create a file containing your aws credentials.

    You can access your AWS access ID and AWS secret key:
    http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key

    You must create the file $HOME/.aws-credentials-master, here is a template:

    # Enter the AWS Keys without the < or >
    # You can either use the AWS Accounts access keys and they can be found at
    # http://aws.amazon.com under Account->Security Credentials
    # or you can use the access keys of a user created with IAM
    AWSAccessKeyId=<Write your AWS access ID>
    AWSSecretKey=<Write your AWS secret key>

    To preserve your credentials don't forget to:
    chmod 600 $HOME/.aws-credentials-master

    To export the needed variables, add them to your dotfiles.
      * On Bash, add them to `~/.bash_profile`.
      * On Zsh, add them to `~/.zprofile` instead.

    export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home)"
    export AWS_IAM_HOME="#{prefix}/jars"
    export AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE=$HOME/.aws-credentials-master
    EOS
  end
end
