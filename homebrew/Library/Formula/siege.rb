  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    Mac OS X has only 16K ports available that won't be released until socket
    TIME_WAIT is passed. The default timeout for TIME_WAIT is 15 seconds.
    Consider reducing in case of available port bottleneck.

    You can check whether this is a problem with netstat:

        # sysctl net.inet.tcp.msl
        net.inet.tcp.msl: 15000

        # sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.msl=1000
        net.inet.tcp.msl: 15000 -> 1000

    Run siege.config to create the ~/.siegerc config file.
