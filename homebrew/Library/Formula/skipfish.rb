    NOTE: Skipfish uses dictionary-based probes and will not run until
    you have specified a dictionary for it to use. Please read:
      #{libexec}/dictionaries/README-FIRST
    carefully to make the right choice. This step has a profound impact
    on the quality of results later on.

    Use this command to print usage information:
      skipfish -h
    EOS
  end
