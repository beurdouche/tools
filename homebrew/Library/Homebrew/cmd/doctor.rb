    Some keg-only formula are linked into the Cellar.
    Linking a keg-only formula, such as gettext, into the cellar with
    `brew link f` will cause other formulae to detect them during the
    `./configure` step. This may cause problems when compiling those
    other formulae.

    Binaries provided by keg-only formulae may override system binaries
    with other strange results.
