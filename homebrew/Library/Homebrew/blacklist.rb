    Apple distributes #{name} with OS X, you can find it in /usr/bin.

    Apple distributes #{name} with OS X, you can find it in /usr/lib.
    Some build scripts fail to detect it correctly, please check existing
    formulae for solutions.

  when 'libxml', 'libxlst' then <<-EOS.undent
    Apple distributes #{name} with OS X, you can find it in /usr/lib.
    However not all build scripts look for these hard enough, so you may need
    to call ENV.libxml2 in your formula's install function.

  when 'freetype', 'libpng' then <<-EOS.undent
    Apple distributes #{name} with OS X, you can find it in /usr/X11/lib.
    However not all build scripts look here, so you may need to call ENV.x11
    in your formula's install function.

  when 'wxwidgets' then <<-EOS.undent
    An old version of wxWidgets can be found in /usr/X11/lib. However, Homebrew
    does provide a newer version, 2.8.10:

        brew install wxmac

  when 'tex', 'tex-live', 'texlive' then <<-EOS.undent
    Installing TeX from source is weird and gross, requires a lot of patches,
    and only builds 32-bit (and thus can't use Homebrew deps on Snow Leopard.)

    We recommend using a MacTeX distribution: http://www.tug.org/mactex/

    Install pip with easy_install:

    MacRuby works better when you install their package:

    Although if you prefer, there is a formula in homebrew-alt.
    EOS
  when 'npm' then <<-EOS.undent
    Homebrew does not provide npm because it is self-updating. To install it, first
    `brew install nodejs' and then:

        curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
